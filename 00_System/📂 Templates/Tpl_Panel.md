## 🚁 The Feynman View (The Aerial Scan)
> **[Elevator Pitch Protocol]:**
> Imagine you are in an elevator with a smart 12-year-old. You have 30 seconds to explain what this "floor" (note) is about.
> * **Prohibited:** Jargon dumping.
> * **Mandatory:** Describe the "Movement" of the structure and its core utility.
> *(Draft your high-level synthesis here)*

## ⚛️ The Collider (The Panel)
*This is the reactor core where Logic meets Intuition. Do not just store here; create "Tension."*

### ⚔️ 1. The Dialectic (Logic)
* **Thesis:** `[[Block A]]` (The Established View)
* **Antithesis:** `[[Block B]]` (The Counter-View / Anomaly)
* **Synthesis:** Under [Condition X], A applies. Under [Condition Y], B applies. Truth is dynamic.

### 🖼️ 2. The Interval (Lateral Montage)
*Cross-Domain Juxtaposition. Truth is found not in A or B, but in the "Interval" between them.*
* **The Juxtaposition:** Placing `[[Current Subject Block]]` next to `[[Remote Domain Concept]]` (e.g., Biology vs. Architecture).
* **The Tension:** Why do these two unrelated things share the same shape?
* **The Pathosformel:** [The Emerging Pattern / The Scene].
    * *Insight:* "This isn't just a Marketing Funnel; structurally, it acts exactly like Cellular Osmosis."

### 🌉 3. The Void (The Gap)
* **Observation:** [The Visible Result]
* **Axiom:** [The Known Principle]
* **The Missing Link:** Why did the Principle fail to predict the Result? What variable is missing?
* **👉 Research Task:** [Specific direction for inquiry]

## 🏗️ The Mnemosyne Board (The Artifacts)
*Transcluded components (Bricks and Traces).*

### 🧱 Roots (Axioms / First Principles)
* ![[Insight Block: ...]]

### 🧩 Branches (Mechanisms / Processes)
* ![[Insight Block: ...]]

### 🌱 Engrams (Seeds / Memory Traces)
* *Formerly "Leaves" (Facts). These are high-value "Orphans" waiting for connection.*
* ![[Seed Card: ...]]

## 🚧 Mitosis Protocol (System Integrity)
*Execute when the note exceeds cognitive load:*
* [ ] **Word Count Alert:** Is the Feynman View > 300 words? -> **Rewrite or Split.**
* [ ] **Tension Failure:** Is the Montage section just random fluff? -> **Find a better metaphor or delete.**
* [ ] **Layer Error:** Are there too many loose Engrams here? -> **Create a Child Note and move them.**

## ❓ The Frontier (Blueprint)
* [Next logical gap to bridge]
