## I. Core Principle for WeChat (One Line)

> **One post = one cognitive action.**  
> Never more.

Your system is cathedral-scale; WeChat demands **chapels**.

---

## II. The Serial Unit (Your Atomic Post)

Each WeChat post should execute **exactly one of the following blocks**.

### Allowed Blocks per Post

- Text + Context Capsule
    
- Philology
    
- Syntax
    
- Network
    
- Critical Commentary
    
- Theory
    
- Temporal Recursion
    
- Practicum (questions only)
    

**Never mix blocks in one post.**

This preserves:

- rhythm
    
- reader trust
    
- rereadability
    

---

## III. The Canonical Serial Rhythm (8–Post Cycle)

This is the **default cycle** you repeat.

### Post 1 — Immersion

**Title style:**

> _Proust, Combray (I): The Sentence Before Meaning_

**Content:**

- Phase 1: Text (shortened to 400–600 words for WeChat)
    
- Phase 1b: Context Capsule
    

**Reader task:** read, not understand.
- Phase 2-I.a — Constraint Vocabulary
    
- Phase 2-I.b — Translation & Resistance
    
- Phase 2-I.c — Conversion & Equivalence
---

### Post 2 — Philology

**Title:**

> _What This Sentence Refuses to Mean Easily_

**Content:**

- Phase 2-I (2–4 words only, not exhaustive)
    

**Reader task:** slow attention.

---

### Post 3 — Syntax

**Title:**

> _Why This Sentence Does Not End When It Ends_

**Content:**

- Phase 2-II
    
- 1–2 sentences only
    

**Reader task:** feel duration.

---

### Post 4 — Network

**Title:**

> _This Moment Will Return (Much Later)_

**Content:**

- Phase 2-III
    
- No plot, only echoes
    

**Reader task:** accept delay.

---

### Post 5 — Critical Commentary

**Title:**

> _How Others Have Read This (And Where They Stop)_

**Content:**

- Phase 2-IVa
    
- 2 critics max per post
    

**Reader task:** see reading as pressure, not truth.

---

### Post 6 — Theory

**Title:**

> _Why This Is Not Just Literature_

**Content:**

- Phase 2-IVb
    
- 1 discipline only
    

**Reader task:** expand cautiously.

---

### Post 7 — Temporal Recursion

**Title:**

> _This Sentence Will Become Something Else_

**Content:**

- Phase 2-IVc
    
- 1 future moment only
    

**Reader task:** reread mentally.

---

### Post 8 — Practicum

**Title:**

> _Questions You Cannot Answer Yet_

**Content:**

- Phase 2-VI
    
- 3 questions max
    

**Reader task:** stay with uncertainty.

---

## IV. Where the Negative Reading Circle Lives (Important)

You **do not name it** in posts.

Instead, you enforce it editorially:

- You stop explanations early
    
- You leave one thing unresolved per post
    
- You end with silence, not summary
    

That is how readers _feel_ the constraint.

---

## V. Reader Onboarding (First-Time Readers)

You need **one pinned post**, nothing more.

### Pinned Post (Evergreen)

**Title:**

> _How to Read This Series_

**Content (5 short bullets):**

- These posts are slow by design
    
- Understanding arrives late
    
- Rereading is expected
    
- Not every question will be answered
    
- Confusion is not failure here
    

End with one line:

> _This series assumes that meaning emerges over time._

That’s enough. Don’t over-explain.

---

## VI. Visual Rhythm (WeChat-Specific)

- Short paragraphs (1–2 lines)
    
- White space after every analytic move
    
- Code blocks only for Context Capsule or quotations
    
- Never bold conclusions
    
- Never end with “总结”
    

Let silence do work.

---

## VII. Sustainable Pace (So You Don’t Burn Out)

Recommended cadence:

- **2 posts per week**
    
- One full 8-post cycle per month
    
- One passage = one month
    

This signals seriousness and builds anticipation.

---

## VIII. What This Workflow Achieves

- New readers are not overwhelmed
    
- Serious readers feel respected
    
- The system reveals itself slowly
    
- Proust’s temporality is **mirrored by publication time**
    

Your series doesn’t just _talk_ about delayed meaning.  
It **enacts** it.

---

## IX. One-Line Editorial North Star

Keep this visible when you write:

> **If a post feels complete, it is probably wrong.**

---

If you want next, I can:

- draft the **exact pinned onboarding post**, or
    
- mock up **titles + summaries for the first full 8-post cycle**, or
    
- help you **decide where to start in Combray** for maximum reader retention.
    

You choose.
