# Phase 2-IVa: Critical Commentary (Canonical Readers)

**Focus:** Proust read by major critics on the passage concerning the writer as translator, the materials of literature, and the deciphering of signs.

---

## 📍 Critical Voice 1: Walter Benjamin (1892–1940)

**Conceptual Lens:** Translation theory; the aura; the image of Proust.

**Recognizable Claim:**

In his 1929 essay "The Image of Proust," Benjamin writes:

> "Proust's style is not so much a description of the interior life as a description of the interior life *as seen from the outside*—that is, as seen by the writer who has become a reader of himself. He is the writer who has learned to read his own life as if it were a text written by another."

This directly glosses the passage: "The book whose characters are figured, not by us, but by our lives, is the only book that is really ours." Benjamin recognizes that Proust's "translation" metaphor is not merely decorative but *structural*: the writer must become estranged from his own life in order to read it.

**Illumination:**

Benjamin's lens reveals that the "translator" is not a mediator between languages but between selves. The "I" who writes is not the "I" who lived; the task is to translate the experience of the past self into the language of the present self without falsifying either. This explains why Proust insists that the materials are "stored up without my divining their destination"—the past self does not know it is writing a book; the present self must decipher what was written.

**Limit:**

Benjamin's framework, focused on the *image* and the *aura*, cannot account for the *sensory mechanics* of the passage. He reads Proust's theory of memory but not Proust's syntax of memory. The claim that "Proust's style is a description of the interior life as seen from the outside" illuminates the *position* of the narrator but not the *movement* of the sentences—the hypotaxis, the suspension, the delayed revelation that enacts the very process of "drawing forth from the shadow."

## 📍 Critical Voice 2: Gilles Deleuze (1925–1995)

**Conceptual Lens:** Signs; apprenticeship; the search for truth.

**Recognizable Claim:**

In *Proust and Signs* (1964), Deleuze argues:

> "The Search is not a deployment of memory but a search for truth. And truth is not revealed; it is *encountered*, *deciphered*, *interpreted*. It is inseparable from a process of apprenticeship that involves signs. The madeleine is not a memory; it is a sign. The task is not to remember but to *learn to read*."

This is a direct reading of the passage: "to interpret the given sensations as signs of so many laws and ideas." Deleuze shifts the emphasis from memory (psychological) to semiotics (structural). Proust's narrator is not recovering a past but *learning a language*—the language of signs that life has written.

**Illumination:**

Deleuze's lens reveals why Proust insists that the writer "must not merely copy them from his memory, but has to recreate them." Memory is insufficient; what is required is *interpretation*. The "pink reflection on the flower-covered wall" is not a memory to be reproduced but a sign to be deciphered. The writer's task is not to remember that the wall was pink but to understand what that pinkness *means*—its relation to hunger, desire, luxury, the woman's presence.

**Limit:**

Deleuze's system, for all its precision, risks *over-semiotizing* the text. The passage insists on the *materiality* of the impression—"material because it has entered us through the senses." Deleuze's focus on the sign as abstract meaning can obscure the *bodily* dimension: the uneven paving stones are felt in the feet before they are read by the mind. The "spirit" that Proust seeks to extract is never entirely separable from the body that felt it.

## 📍 Critical Voice 3: Gérard Genette (1930–2018)

**Conceptual Lens:** Narrative discourse; metalepsis; the relation between story and narration.

**Recognizable Claim:**

In "Proust and Indirect Language" (from *Figures III*, 1972), Genette writes:

> "The Proustian narrative is haunted by its own genesis. The story of the narrator's vocation is not simply a theme within the novel; it is the *condition* of the novel's existence. The novel we are reading is the novel the narrator will write. This circularity—the novel about becoming a novelist that is itself the novel that results from that becoming—is the deepest structure of the Recherche."

This addresses the passage's recursive logic: "I realized that the materials of my literary work were my own past life." The narrator discovers, at the end, that he has been living the material for the book he will write—but we have just read that book. The book is the proof of its own possibility.

**Illumination:**

Genette's lens reveals the *temporal paradox* of the passage. When the narrator says "I could die when the plant had developed," he recognizes that the "I" who lived and the "I" who writes are separated by the completion of the work. The work exists because the life existed; but the life, once lived, is over. This is the metalepsis Genette identifies: the narrated life and the narrating life fold into each other.

**Limit:**

Genette's structuralist framework, focused on narrative levels and temporal relations, cannot adequately address the *sensory density* of the passage. He can map the relations between "story" and "narration" but not explain why the "pink reflection on the flower-covered wall" matters. The *material* of literature—the sensations, the impressions—is invisible to his lens, which sees only the architecture that contains them.

## 📍 Critical Voice 4: Roland Barthes (1915–1980)

**Conceptual Lens:** The reality effect; the pleasure of the text; the body in writing.

**Recognizable Claim:**

In "Proust and Photography" (1978), Barthes writes:

> "What Proust seeks is not the past but the *past's past*—the moment before memory, when the sensation was still pure, unmarked by meaning. This is why his work is not a memoir but a *photography*: it tries to capture the light that touched the object before the object became a memory."

This echoes the passage's distinction between what the intellect "eliminates" and what the sensation preserves. The "pink reflection" is not a memory; it is a *trace* of light that existed before memory, before meaning, before the intellect could rationalize it away.

**Illumination:**

Barthes's lens reveals why Proust insists that the truths grasped by the intelligence are "less profound, less necessary." The intelligence arrives *after* the sensation, imposing order on what was originally chaotic. The writer's task is to recover the *before*—the moment when the sensation was still "material," still uninterpreted. This is why Proust calls the task a "translation": it must render the pre-linguistic into language without destroying its pre-linguistic character.

**Limit:**

Barthes's focus on the *photographic*—the capture of light, the trace of the real—cannot account for the *temporal duration* of Proust's sentences. A photograph is instantaneous; a Proustian sentence unfolds in time, forcing the reader to experience the *process* of translation, not just its result. Barthes sees the "past's past" but not the *work* of getting there—the hypotaxis, the suspension, the delayed revelation that enacts the very labor of recovery.

## 📍 Critical Voice 5: Georges Poulet (1902–1991)

**Conceptual Lens:** Time and consciousness; the phenomenology of interiority.

**Recognizable Claim:**

In *Proustian Space* (1963), Poulet writes:

> "For Proust, time is not a succession of moments but a *simultaneity* of spaces. To remember is not to return to a past moment but to enter a past space—a room, a garden, a street—that coexists with the present space. The self is not a point in time but a *topography* of places inhabited at different ages."

This directly addresses the passage's spatialization of time: "the pink reflection of the evening on the flower-covered wall" is not a moment but a *place*—the wall, the restaurant, the evening light. The catalog of eliminated details is a catalog of *spaces* that coexist in the present sensation.

**Illumination:**

Poulet's lens reveals why Proust's sentences are so long, so layered, so resistant to closure. They are not describing a sequence of events but a *space* that contains multiple times simultaneously. The hypotaxis—the clauses piled on clauses—is the grammatical equivalent of this spatial simultaneity. Each subordinate clause adds another layer to the space, another time to the present.

**Limit:**

Poulet's phenomenological framework, focused on consciousness and interiority, cannot adequately address the *materiality* of the signs. He reads the spaces but not the sensations that *trigger* them. The "uneven paving-stones" are not just a space; they are a *physical shock* that opens the space. The body, for Poulet, is secondary to consciousness; for Proust, the body is the *primary* medium through which time is regained.

## 📍 Synthesis: Critical Pressure on the Passage

| Critic | Lens | Illumination | Limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Benjamin | Translation; aura | Writer as reader of self | Misses syntax |
| Deleuze | Signs; apprenticeship | Memory as deciphering | Over-semiotizes |
| Genette | Narrative structure | Temporal paradox | Misses sensation |
| Barthes | Photography; trace | Pre-linguistic purity | Misses duration |
| Poulet | Phenomenology | Time as space | Misses body |

What emerges under this critical pressure is a passage that resists reduction to any single framework:

- Benjamin sees the *position* of the narrator but not the *movement* of the sentences.
- Deleuze sees the *signs* but not the *body* that feels them.
- Genette sees the *architecture* but not the *material* it contains.
- Barthes sees the *trace* but not the *labor* of recovery.
- Poulet sees the *space* but not the *shock* that opens it.

The passage requires *all* these lenses—and exceeds each. Its truth lies not in any single reading but in the *network* of readings it generates and resists. This is the "necessary unknown" that criticism must protect: the passage means more than any interpretation can exhaust.
